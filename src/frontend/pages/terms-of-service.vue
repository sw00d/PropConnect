  <h1><strong>Terms Of Service</strong></h1>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>1. Introduction and Acceptance of the Terms of Service</p>
  <p>Welcome to [PropConnect], a property management assistance service that aims to streamline maintenance processes
    for property management companies. Our Service provides a comprehensive solution that utilizes an advanced
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to handle tenant maintenance requests via a dedicated hotline, facilitating
    communication between tenants, property management companies, and their vendors.</p>
  <p>Here&apos;s how our Service works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Property management companies sign up for our Service, and we establish a
        dedicated maintenance hotline for them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tenants can then send text messages to this hotline to report any
        maintenance needs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Our AI system engages with the tenant, comprehending the nature of the
        request and assigning it to an appropriate vendor from the property management company&apos;s roster.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We set up a new contact line between the tenant and the vendor, allowing
        them to communicate further about the request &ndash; to gather additional details, schedule a convenient time
        for the maintenance work, and so on.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this process, the property management company can monitor,
        manage, and intervene in these conversations as needed.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>While our Service strives to provide the most efficient solutions, we acknowledge that it may not account for all
    potential scenarios and cannot offer a failsafe solution for all maintenance-related issues. Nonetheless, our
    Service aims to significantly alleviate the workload of property management companies, increasing their efficiency
    and tenant satisfaction.</p>
  <p>By using our Service, you agree to these Terms of Service, and any other policies we may put in place from time to
    time. Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using our Service. If you do not agree to these Terms, you
    must not use our Service.</p>
  <p>2. Account Registration and Subscription</p>
  <p>To use our services, you must register for an account with us. During registration, we require the following
    information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Your first and last name</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Your acceptance of terms of service and privacy policy</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Your contact details, including phone number and email address</p>
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The number of doors managed by your company</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is essential for us to provide you with a personalized experience and to ensure that we are
    tailoring our service to the size and scope of your company&apos;s operations.</p>
  <p>Upon successful registration, you will be prompted to provide a form of payment for the subscription fee associated
    with our services. The subscription begins once the payment has been processed successfully. Please note that the
    usage of our services implies that you agree to pay any charges incurred in connection with your account. Charges
    will be billed to your payment method on file.</p>
  <p>Please ensure that the information provided during account registration is accurate, current, and complete. You
    agree to promptly update your account information with any changes that might occur over time, especially your
    contact and payment information. In case of any inaccuracies or discrepancies in the account information, we reserve
    the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our service.</p>
  <p>3. Services Description</p>
  <p>Our Service is designed specifically for property management companies looking for a more efficient way to handle
    maintenance requests from tenants. The key feature of our service is the dedicated text hotline, empowered by an
    advanced AI system, that aims to streamline communication and processes related to maintenance work.</p>
  <p>Here&apos;s a detailed breakdown of our Service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dedicated Maintenance Hotline: Each property management company signed up
        with us is assigned a unique text hotline. This serves as the primary contact point for tenants to report any
        maintenance issues they encounter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;AI-powered Assistance: The core of our service is our sophisticated AI
        system. When a tenant texts the hotline with a maintenance request, the AI assesses the message, understands the
        nature of the problem, and assigns the request to an appropriate vendor from the company&apos;s approved
        list.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Direct Communication Line: To facilitate follow-ups on maintenance
        requests, our service sets up a direct communication line between the vendor and the tenant. This line is used
        for any further discussions &ndash; from gathering additional details about the problem to scheduling a
        convenient time for the work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring and Management: Our service provides a dashboard for property
        management companies where they can monitor and manage these conversations, and step in as necessary. This gives
        companies more control and insight into the maintenance work being done in their properties.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Subscription Plans: Our service is subscription-based</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>By combining technology and convenience, we offer a service that brings simplicity and efficiency to the management
    of maintenance requests, freeing up valuable resources for property management companies. While our service aims to
    cover a wide range of scenarios and needs, it&apos;s important to note that it&apos;s not a failsafe solution for
    all maintenance-related issues.</p>
  <p>As a user of our Service, it is your responsibility to ensure that you use our Service in a manner consistent with
    all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations. You are also responsible for all
    actions that occur in connection with your account.<br><br>4. Payments and Billing</p>
  <p>Our service operates on a subscription basis with a monthly fee, supplemented by a per-conversation charge for each
    interaction hosted by our dedicated hotline(s).</p>
  <p>Here&apos;s a breakdown of our billing process and policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Monthly Subscription Fee: Once you have successfully registered for our
        service and provided your payment information, you will be billed a monthly subscription fee. This fee will be
        charged automatically to your chosen payment method on the same date each month that corresponds to the
        commencement of your subscription.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Per-Conversation Charge: In addition to the monthly subscription fee, we
        also charge a fee for each conversation hosted by our hotline(s). This fee will be calculated based on the
        number of conversations that took place in a billing cycle and will be added to your monthly invoice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Billing Cycle: Our billing cycle is monthly, and the charges will include
        your monthly subscription fee and any per-conversation charges that have been accrued in the past month. You
        will receive an invoice at the end of each billing cycle with a detailed breakdown of the charges.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Methods: We accept payments via the methods specified during the
        registration process. It is your responsibility to maintain valid payment information in your account.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Failed or Late Payments: If a payment cannot be processed due to the
        payment method on file being invalid or for any other reason, we will attempt to contact you to update your
        payment information. Continued failure to meet payment obligations may result in suspension or termination of
        your account.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Refund Policy: All fees charged are non-refundable except as expressly
        stated in these Terms of Service or as required by applicable law. Please ensure to cancel any subscriptions
        before the next billing cycle if you do not wish to continue using our service.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to the Fee Structure: We reserve the right to modify our fee
        structure, billing practices, or payment methods. Any changes will be communicated to you in advance, and
        continued use of the Service after the changes have been implemented constitutes acceptance of the changes.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>5. User Obligations and Responsibilities</p>
  <p>As a user of our service, you have certain obligations and responsibilities to ensure the proper and effective use
    of the service. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Active Engagement: Our service is intended to be a tool to assist in the
        management of maintenance requests, not a replacement for a human maintenance coordinator. Therefore, regular
        engagement with the service is expected. You, as the property manager, should log into the system frequently to
        monitor requests, manage new conversations, and respond to new messages in ongoing conversations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oversight Responsibility: We provide a platform to facilitate and
        streamline the communication and management of maintenance requests, but we do not oversee or control the
        individual conversations or interactions that take place. It&apos;s up to the individual property manager to
        monitor these interactions and address any issues or discrepancies that may arise.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vendor Management: If a vendor is sent on a job they are not qualified
        for, charges an exorbitant amount, isn&apos;t verified to work on the house, etc., we are not responsible. It is
        your responsibility as the property management company to oversee and manage your vendor relationships,
        including but not limited to, vendor selection, verification, cost negotiation, and quality assurance.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with Laws: You must use our service in a manner that is
        consistent with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations.</p>
    </li>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Prohibited Behaviors: Any misuse of our service, including but not

  <p><br></p>
  <p>9. Termination</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend, terminate, or deny your access to and use of the service, at our sole discretion,

    informal and confidential mediation process, facilitated by a mutually agreed upon mediator.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Arbitration: If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation or mediation, the dispute shall be resolved by
    binding arbitration administered by a recognized arbitration institution that both parties agree upon, in accordance
    with its applicable rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court
    having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where PropConnect so
    desires.</p>
  <p><br></p>

    these Terms of Service and to resolve your claims by arbitration.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
    dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this agreement to
    arbitrate.<br><br><br>11. Changes to Terms</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p><br></p>
  <p>These Terms of Service and any dispute or claim arising out of, or related to them, shall be governed by and
    construed in accordance with the internal laws of The United States without giving effect to any choice or conflict
    of law provision or rule.</p>
  <p><br></p>
